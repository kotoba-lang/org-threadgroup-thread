;; Run the suite on the ClojureScript side.

;; Not a formality. `thread.mesh`'s 64-bit addresses use the same
;; quot/mod/+'/*' pattern `org-csa-iot-zigbee` documents for exactly this
;; reason, and `thread.iphc`'s Traffic Class / Flow Label packing does
;; several `bit-shift-left`/`bit-or` combinations whose intermediate
;; values can carry a set top bit — precisely the shape that goes
;; negative under ClojureScript's 32-bit signed bitwise semantics and
;; stays correct on the JVM's 64-bit ones. This also exercises the git
;; dependency on `org-csa-iot-zigbee` end to end under nbb, not just
;; under the JVM.
